==============================================
Proton-exchange membrane fuel cell assumptions
==============================================
The following assumptions have been made in the calculation of the PEMFC stack.

* The hydrogen and oxygen (or air) in the PEMFC stack are consider as ideal gas.
* The operating temperature of the PEMFC remains constant with pre-defined value.
* The hydrogen operating pressure remains constant as defined by the user in the input file.
* The oxygen partial pressure is set to 21% of the operating pressure.
* The operating pressure is equivalent to ambient pressure if no compressor is connected.
* The pressure of both electrodes in empirical polarization model are assumed to be equal.
* The fuel utilization coefficient is set to 95% to consider trapped hydrogen in the PEMFC stack.
