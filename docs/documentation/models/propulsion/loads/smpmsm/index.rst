==================================================
Surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor
==================================================

This electric motor model in FAST-OAD-CS23-HE represents a surface-mounted PMSM that generates mechanical power through
the interaction between the permanent magnets in the rotor and the electromagnetical forces generated by the winded wires. This component can be
activated through the powertrain configuration file (PT file). The registered installation positions can be found in
:ref:`options <options-smpmsm>`.
