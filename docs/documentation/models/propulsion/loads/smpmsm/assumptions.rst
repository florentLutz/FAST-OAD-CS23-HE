Surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor assumptions
==============================================================
The following assumptions have been made in the calculation of the surface-mounted PMSM model as presented in the
HASTECS project :cite:`touhami:2020`.

* The motor is assumed to be a radial flux electric motor without salient pole.
* The air gap flux density and the stator winding currents are assumed to be sinusoidally distributed.
* The leakage of magnetic flux is neglected.
* The linear demagnetization curve is expected for the magnetic metal alloy excerpting saturation.
* The shaft diameter is fixed as 1/3 of the rotor diameter.
* The loss between the electromagnetic torque and the output torque is negligible.
* The critical and maximum mechanical rotational speeds are never reached during the mission.
