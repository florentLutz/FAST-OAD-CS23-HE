Surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor assumptions
==============================================================
The following assumptions have been made in the calculation of the surface-mounted PMSM model as presented in the HASTECS project :cite:`touhami:2020`.

* The motor is assumed to be a radial flux electric motor without salient pole.
* The airgap flux density and the stator winding currents are assumed to be sinusoidally distributed.
* The magnetic leakages are neglected.
* The linear magnetic behavior is expected with excerpting the magnetic saturation.
* The shaft diameter is fixed as 1/3 of the rotor diameter.
* The rotor rotational speed is always lower than the first critical rotational speed.
