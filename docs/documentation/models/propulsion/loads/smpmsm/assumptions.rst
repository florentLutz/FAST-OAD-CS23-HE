Surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor assumptions
==============================================================
The following assumptions have been made in the calculation of the Surface-mounted PMSM given by :ref:`touhami:2020`.

* The motor is assumed as a radial flux electric motor without salient pole.
* The airgap flux density and the stator winding currents are assumed to be sinusoidally distributed.
* The magnetic leakage of both types of magnets are neglected.
* The linear magnetic behavior is expected with excerpting the magnetic saturation.
