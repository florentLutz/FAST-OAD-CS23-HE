Tutte's drawing algorithm
=========================
The Tutte spring theorem, proved by W. T. Tutte :cite:`tutte:1963` in 1963, provides an algorithmic approach for drawing
3-connected planar graphs. This method has since been widely applied in computing embeddings of complex planar polygons
when the boundary nodes are appropriately selected.
