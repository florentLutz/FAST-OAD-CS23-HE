A description of the powertrain customization is available here. It includes a description of powertrain configuation
file, lists of the components available with their constraints, a description of powertrain network visualization, and
simple powertrain templates.

    Powertrain configuration (PT) file <pt_file>
    Component Constraints and ID <constraints>
    PT file visualization <pt_visual>
    PT file templates <templates>

.. note::

   Avoid ending PT file names with ``_test`` or ``_temp_copy``.
   Using these suffixes may interfere with several powertrain syntax checks.
