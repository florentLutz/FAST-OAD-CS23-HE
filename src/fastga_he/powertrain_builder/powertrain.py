        optimization to find a new wing area (it can takes minutes). However, for that particular
        observation the whole propulsion chain is not needed. We indeed only need the propulsors
        to compute the slipstream effect and the propulsive load to check that the power rate is
        below 1. Consequently, and only for that particular application, we will produce a
